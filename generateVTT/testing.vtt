 I texted this clip to my wife who wanted proof I wasn't doing anything stupid on a recent trip to the pamas Now if you're wondering what my feet are doing in shark-infested waters with a bucket of blood 20 miles away from any land Well, that comes down to a conversation I had with my friends at the Discovery Channel six months ago They told me shark week is coming up and they want to know what I would do They could put me in the middle of the ocean on a boat Surrounded by sharks for as long as I can remember I've always wanted to test if sharks can really smell a drop of blood in the water from a mile away Now before you say myth busters already did this um, they kind of did this As you can see to test this they poked their fingers and then stuck them in a barrel with these tiny lemon sharks And since they didn't really seem to turn around and look at their fingers They said it was busted now I'm friends with both Carrie and Adam But I think even they would have been at least in this case the methodology was Less than scientifically rigorous so I came up with a more robust test for seager built some NASA great hardware for the experiment Hopped on a plane and then a speedboat and soon enough I was 20 miles off shore of the pamas To kick things off I sat down with my marine biologist shark diving expert friend Luke Tipple and explain my plan to him Eventually I planned to test just how far they could smell a single drop of blood in the water But first I wanted proof that they actually preferred blood over any other scent so from my first experiment I plan to put four surfboards in the water equal distance from the back of the boat each board would host two liters of a different liquid That we would pump into the ocean over the course of an hour then using a three meter radius around each board is a gauge We would use drone footage and count how many sharks went over to check out each board So this board would be fish oil, which I heard was a general attractant for lots of fish Then we would have cows blood here then seawater here as a control Let's make sure the sharks weren't just interested in the surfboard and then finally urine I've heard from surfers that a lot of them won't be in their wet suits because they feel like it's gonna track the shark I don't know so for a life it doesn't pee in their wet I thought yes, there's definitely something that I've heard a lot I can't liberate surfers everywhere We sure that it's called a pee in your wet suit And so after a bit more discussion Luke was on board for the first of our two experiments Well as a fur believer in the scientific method We'll test it out And then you do it Well depending on the results I'm not sure I can't pee the deals off And so with that we started putting the foreborks together We also started collecting scientific donations from the crew Alright so now it's time to fill these bags What do you want to do first? Peer of blood? Yeah you Let's do pee Okay, let's do rock paper scissors for who holds the bucket and who holds the bag Alright, we'll do three shoots I got a strategy Okay I know what it is You ready? One, two, three shoots Yeah! Oh that smells so bad It's urine Whoever it is they need to hydrate Dude this is gonna be a nightmare Oh it's mold Oh dude it's all in the hand You're pouring socks Okay, oh that's nice We're good All in the name of science That's a great time of day to be doing this Because we have a lot of sharks looking down here We've got three or four lemons on the surface And I can actually see two tigers down on the bottom And that's actually a massive tiger that is down there Huge Alright see if you can do a better out of pouring than I did Oh my gosh Oh wow There's a feeding frenzy It's fine What are you doing? I almost lost my hand It did not It's not gonna jump out of the water Okay so we've got sea water, it's our control, fish oil Have urine And cow's blood So while Luke is bravely swimming the four surfboards out And anchoring them in place in preparation for the one hour countdown Now is a perfect time to explain the cool tech on each board I designed and built from scratch with my buddy Sean Hodgins For this experiment to be robust all four boards need to start pumping at the exact same time after Luke has them in place That means we need to somehow start the pumps using a radio signal from the boat So each surfboard has a waterproof receiver box like this that also hosts the battery, a custom printed circuit board and two Arduino's Then I have the remote control and as soon as I hit this button They all start pumping at the same time We know each pump is working because the corresponding other light is lit up That's important because they're too far away from the boat to see if they're functioning properly To pump the blood and pee we're using a parasol-tick pump This is a perfect choice because it's a totally sterile way to get the blood from the bag to the ocean Since the blood never touches any sort of valve or something It just has these rollers that sort of pinch and push the blood through the tubing In a manner that just happens to be similar to a severed artery And so with the boards in place It was go time Operation Sharkbait Test Thing Commence Three, two, one All four are going, we have confirmation Everything is rolling, the experiment is underway We'll let them go for an hour just tripping stuff out And yeah, let's see what happens I came out to get the blood on the board, the blood on the board I can see a ton of trash on the board, but I can see it's on the board on the board I can see a ton of trash on the board, I can see a ton of trash on the board I can see a ton of trash on the board, but I can see a ton of trash on the board And after 10 minutes I was really surprised There wasn't a lot of action on any of the boards So so far it's pretty interesting I mean, we've shown if you have a massive cut and you're bleeding out And there's this mini sharks within like 50 yards of you That they're kind of like meh So like already that's an interesting finding, right? You think a little bit of blood and there's just a massive swarm But that's not the case so far And to be clear, we weren't dealing with small quantities here The human body contains five liters of blood And after you lose two liters, which is the exact amount we're putting in the water, then you die About 20 minutes in, things were still pretty quiet Especially if the fish oil urine and control boards But then the blood boards started attracting some smaller fish And soon after, one or two sharks started taking notice Not a lot of love for my pee I don't know why I find that kind of offensive, but I'm just a little hurt Eventually, with about 15 minutes left, things started getting pretty wild over by the bloodboard The blood was spread out and made almost like a blood runway So you have this surreal line of sharks swimming up this enticing blood trail, one after another Only to be super disappointed to find a big piece of styrofoam We're almost done Three, two, one The motors have soft, our experiment is done I just like to point out the bags have been sucked dry So the engineering part of this experiment works flawlessly Dude, those sharks everywhere Are you serious? Yeah And so now it's time to go in and review the footage and get a final tally for each board And what we found was that four sharks went to check out the fish oil Then zero sharks went to check out both the control and the urine And then the bloodboard had a direct visit from a whopping 41 sharks And so now that we debunked some surfing myths about urine and proved that sharks certainly had a strong preference for blood over anything we tested The real question was just how much blood is interesting to that And there was one part of the experimental design that was really nagging at me Because that was cow's blood, right? That was cow's blood You want to do human blood? I want to try human blood We've got at least 10 living, breathing blood bags around here It's worth noting not everyone was stoked as Luke and I about this idea Yeah, and then just draw it, we'll just have fresh blood, just mainline it and put it in the water Why not? Would you be down? I would be down My dog, what are you reckon? Don't look at me You have all the P1, you can have my blood So Luke made some calls and soon enough we had an amazing certified Bahami in Fulbotum as Dombord I'm like, oh I'm totally cool, I thought it popped up off And after some generosity from the camera crew and even Captain Scotty, we had four bulging bags of human blood for our second experiment This is my actual blood We're just gonna see if sharks have a taste for it And if they do, I probably won't go pretty good with them For the second experiment, we had three boards Again, we placed the control in the middle The board over here would pump the human blood slowly at one drop a minute And then on the other side, this board would pump the blood fast on average one drop every four seconds We were able to do that because another cool feature for the box as we built was that by turning this knob You can control the flow rate so over time they can pump out different amounts And because sometimes we all have to step up and just do our part While Luke once again risks his life by placing the three boards, I prepared to push a button Three, two, one Commence Alright, all of them are pumping good to go and now the clock's ticking We have like 55 more minutes to go We'll see if the sharks notice it One drop of human blood every four seconds may sound like a lot and it certainly is But it's also important to note that's 40 times less than the first experiment where we saw so much activity In this case, halfway into experiment number two Even though there were tons of sharks still in the area, the boards themselves were pretty quiet We'll have to see when we look at the footage afterwards but so far it looks like the answer's no Five, four, three, two, one Experiment's over And so after the full hour we brought in the boards and once again reviewed the footage to see that over the course of an hour Zero sharks checked out the control board, zero checked out the slow blood pumping board And exactly zero sharks checked out the fast one So this was by no means a perfect experiment But I think it's safe to qualitatively say that if no sharks came to check out 15 drops of human blood a minute In the middle of shark infested waters, you're probably going to be okay with a small scrape I mean there certainly won't be some kind of feeding frenzy with a single drop of blood from all sharks within a mile Now that I had some first-hand data to put my mind at ease, I was willing to try diving with the sharks without a cage But I had one final experiment I had a theory that if we secured a 360 camera to the front of a hand spear and then shot it near some sharks We could create the world's first really cool matrix-like underwater bullet time effect So I suited it up and got in And my theory proved correct on the bullet time hand spear Because as you can see that footage turned out really cool I'm going to have to go back to the water Wow, you're awesome I'm not strong in your hands I'm going to die Stay safe, he moves Making sense of a new, I know I say no of a new On that note, here we come on that I want to get done that That was amazing, man We got a feeding frenzy there's like six of them all around us And they lived, I mean this is cheap enough to be a great day What I'll take home from this shoot is just more evidence of the amazing animal that sharks are But also the ability to point people in a specific direction to say, hey, your thoughts about them are a little overblown This experience definitely changed my perception on sharks I would say I respect them more after seeing their raw power up close But at the same time there's less of that fear that comes from ignorance I'll talk about that, I didn't die You
