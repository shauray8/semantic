## Semantic search engine for the internet !

### ToDo
[ ] where to get the dataset ? (youtube maybe ?)<br>
[ ] process the dataset and create some kind of JSON file (refr - mail)

### Research (More like documenting my work flow)
So this is just my initital thinking BUT can I find .vrts or .vtt files ? I don't think so !<br>
What if I could create .vrts or .vtt (i prefer .vtt more its easy and fun) this could expland 
the operations ! <br>
Now how do I create my own .vtt file ? Okay so how the .vtt file looks like - <br>
1. it contains basic things such as the time and the dialogue spoken in that time frame !
<br>
Can I use whisper ? <br>

I think I will go with Whisper and convert some video data into audio transcription and convert all of it to a .vtt file and then continue with the rest of the architecture ! <br>
This approch drastically improves the scope of the project, now the project is not limited to a ceratin dataset or some bullshit <br>
NOW the question is what video dataset I should choose ? I want a dataset that should unlock full potential of my search engine <br>
1. Mark Rober (this is the first thing what comes to my mind when I think enducational and a lot of real world fotage ) Yeah I will go with MARK ROBER ! <br>
